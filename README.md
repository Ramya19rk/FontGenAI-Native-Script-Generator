# FontGenAI-Native-Script-Generator

# Overview

FontGenAI is an AI-powered tool designed to generate font libraries for native languages such as Hindi, Malayalam, Tamil, and more. The project leverages machine learning techniques to automate the creation of entire font libraries from a few sample characters, addressing the limited availability of exhaustive font libraries for these languages.

# Features

## Character Recognition: 
Trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize and generate native language characters.

## Model Evaluation: 
Achieved high accuracy in character recognition through comprehensive testing and evaluation.

## Visualization: 
Included visualization of training history, confusion matrix, and sample predictions.

## Model Saving and Loading: 
Saved the trained model for future use and inference.
